# Python Programs Collection

This repository is a personal collection of small Python programs created as part of my journey to master Python. Each script demonstrates a specific concept, feature, or mini-project, and is intended for learning, experimentation, and reference.

## Folder Structure

- **mini-projects/**  
  Contains other stand-alone code, usually focusing on a particular concept.

- **games/**  
  Contains simple Python games for practice and fun, such as number guessing, among others.

- **tutorial/**  
  Includes scripts and exercises covering various Python topics, organized by week or concept. Useful for step-by-step learning and revision.

- **custom-modules/**  
  Houses custom utility modules, such as input handlers and custom exceptions, to support the main programs and encourage code reuse.

- **docs/**  
  Documentation and notes related to the learning journey.

## Virtual Environment Setup

It is recommended to use a virtual environment for this project:

```
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate           # On Linux
.venv\Scripts\activate               # On windows
pip install -r requirements.txt     # requirments.txt in docs folder
```

If you're using `custom_modules`, ensure the root path is discoverable by Python. You can add a `.pth` file or set the `PYTHONPATH` accordingly.


## Purpose

This folder is a showcase of small Python programs written during my learning process. Each file is self-contained and focuses on a particular concept or mini-project.

Feel free to explore, use, and modify the scripts for your own learning! Feel free to connect with me if you have any suggestions/questions.
